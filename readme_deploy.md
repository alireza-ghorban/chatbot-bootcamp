Thank you for sharing the screenshot and the student’s issue regarding the chatbot application. The student is encountering a problem where the chatbot, instead of returning a normal text response, is displaying raw HTML content. Let’s analyze the issue based on the screenshot, the error description, and the code from Stage 4 (since Stage 5 is a deployment of Stage 4 on an Azure VM). I’ll break down the problem, identify the root cause, and provide a solution to ensure the chatbot returns plain text responses instead of raw HTML.

### Problem Analysis

#### Screenshot Details
- The screenshot shows the Streamlit frontend of the chatbot application running on `localhost:8501`.
- The user has a chat named "Ghadi" selected.
- The user sends a message: "Hello".
- The assistant’s response is raw HTML content:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> <--

  ...
  ```
- This HTML content appears to be an error page, likely from a server-side issue, rather than the expected chatbot response.

#### Code Context (Stage 4)
- **Frontend (`chatbot.py`)**:
  - The frontend sends a POST request to either `/chat/` (for regular chat) or `/rag_chat/` (for PDF-associated chats) based on whether a PDF is linked to the chat.
  - The response is streamed and displayed using `st.write_stream(get_stream_response)`.
  - The `get_stream_response` function decodes the streamed chunks as UTF-8:
    ```python
    def get_stream_response():
        with requests.post(chat_taret_url, json=payload, headers=headers, stream=True) as r:
            for chunk in r:
                yield chunk.decode("utf-8")
    response = st.write_stream(get_stream_response)
    ```
  - Since no PDF is associated with the "Ghadi" chat (no "Associate with: [pdf_name]" is shown in the UI), the request is sent to `/chat/`.

- **Backend (`backend.py`)**:
  - The `/chat/` endpoint directly calls the OpenAI API and streams the response:
    ```python
    @app.post("/chat/")
    async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
        try:
            stream = client.chat.completions.create(
                model=model,
                messages=request.messages,
                stream=True,
            )
            def stream_response():
                for chunk in stream:
                    delta = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
                    if delta:
                        yield delta
            return StreamingResponse(stream_response(), media_type="text/plain")
        except Exception as e:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
    ```
  - The response is expected to be plain text (`media_type="text/plain"`), and the `delta.content` should contain the assistant’s message.

#### Root Cause
The assistant’s response is raw HTML instead of plain text, which suggests the following possibilities:

1. **Backend Request Failure**:
   - The request to `/chat/` (at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat/`) might be failing or reaching the wrong endpoint. The HTML content looks like an error page (e.g., a 404 "Page not found" from Splunk), indicating that the FastAPI backend might not be running correctly, or the request is being misrouted.
   - Since the application is deployed on an Azure VM (Stage 5), there could be a networking issue, such as the FastAPI server not running on port 5000 or a firewall blocking the port.

2. **Port Configuration Issue**:
   - The frontend expects the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, but if the FastAPI server isn’t running on this port (or isn’t accessible), the request might be hitting another service (e.g., Splunk, which is mentioned in the HTML).
   - In Stage 5, the instructions specify running FastAPI with `uvicorn backend:app --reload --port 5000`, but if this wasn’t executed properly, or if another service is occupying port 5000, the request would fail.

3. **OpenAI API Issue**:
   - If the FastAPI server is running but the OpenAI API call fails (e.g., invalid API key, rate limits), the `except` block in `/chat/` would raise an `HTTPException`. However, the HTML response doesn’t match FastAPI’s default error format, so this is less likely.

4. **Streamlit Rendering Issue**:
   - Streamlit’s `st.write_stream` expects plain text, but if the response contains HTML, it will render it as raw text rather than interpreting it as HTML. This aligns with the screenshot but doesn’t explain why HTML is being returned in the first place.

#### Most Likely Cause
The HTML error page mentioning "Splunk" and "Page not found" strongly suggests that the request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat/` is not reaching the FastAPI backend. Instead, it’s hitting another service (possibly Splunk) running on the VM or a default error page from a misconfigured network setup. This could happen if:
- The FastAPI server isn’t running on port 5000.
- The port 5000 inbound rule wasn’t properly configured on the Azure VM.
- Another service (e.g., Splunk) is running on port 5000, causing a conflict.

---

### Solution

To resolve the issue and ensure the chatbot returns plain text responses, we need to verify that the FastAPI backend is running correctly and accessible on the expected port. Here’s a step-by-step fix:

#### 1. Verify FastAPI Server is Running
- **On the Azure VM**:
  - SSH into the VM using VS Code (as done in Stage 5).
  - Navigate to the project directory where `backend.py` is located.
  - Check if the FastAPI server is running:
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep uvicorn
    ```
  - If no process is found, start the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn backend:app --reload --port 5000
    ```
  - Ensure you’re in the Miniconda environment where the project dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
    ```

#### 2. Check for Port Conflicts
- Verify that port 5000 is not occupied by another service (e.g., Splunk):
  ```bash
  sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5000
  ```
- If another service is using port 5000:
  - Either stop the conflicting service (e.g., `sudo systemctl stop <service-name>` if it’s Splunk or another process).
  - Or change the FastAPI port in both `backend.py` and `chatbot.py`:
    - Update `chatbot.py`:
      ```python
      CHAT_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:5001/chat/"
      RAG_CHAT_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:5001/rag_chat/"
      ```
    - Run FastAPI on port 5001:
      ```bash
      uvicorn backend:app --reload --port 5001
      ```

#### 3. Verify Inbound Port Rules on Azure VM
- In the Azure Portal:
  - Go to the VM’s "Networking" settings.
  - Check the inbound security rules.
  - Ensure port 5000 (or the new port, e.g., 5001) is open for HTTP traffic:
    - Add a rule if missing:
      - Port: 5000 (or 5001)
      - Protocol: TCP
      - Source: Any (or your IP for security)
      - Action: Allow
  - Also ensure port 8501 (Streamlit) and 8000 (Chroma) are open, as they were required in Stage 4.

#### 4. Test the Backend Endpoint
- From the VM, test the `/chat/` endpoint directly to confirm it’s working:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
  ```
- If this returns a plain text response (e.g., the assistant’s reply), the backend is working.
- If it returns HTML or fails, there might be an issue with the OpenAI API key or the FastAPI setup:
  - Check the `.env` file on the VM to ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correct.
  - Verify that the required packages (`fastapi`, `openai`, etc.) are installed in the Miniconda environment.

#### 5. Restart Streamlit
- If the backend is now working, restart the Streamlit app:
  - Ensure Chroma is running:
    ```bash
    chroma run --path /db_path
    ```
  - Restart Streamlit:
    ```bash
    streamlit run chatbot.py
    ```
- Test the chat again by sending a message like "Hello". The response should now be plain text.

#### 6. Debug Streamlit Rendering (if needed)
- If the response is still HTML but the `curl` test worked, the issue might be in how Streamlit processes the response. Ensure the `media_type` in the backend’s `StreamingResponse` is correctly set to `"text/plain"`, which it already is in the code. If the issue persists, log the raw response before rendering:
  - Modify `chatbot.py` to debug:
    ```python
    def get_stream_response():
        with requests.post(chat_taret_url, json=payload, headers=headers, stream=True) as r:
            for chunk in r:
                print(chunk)  # Debug: Print raw chunk
                yield chunk.decode("utf-8")
    ```
  - Check the logs to see what the backend is returning.

#### 7. Commit and Push Changes (if any)
- If you made changes (e.g., port adjustments), commit them:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Fixed port conflict and HTML response issue"
  git push origin stage-6
  ```
- Update the pull request on GitHub as needed.

---

### Expected Outcome
After following these steps, the chatbot should respond with plain text instead of raw HTML. For example, sending "Hello" should yield a response like "Hi! How can I assist you today?" instead of an HTML error page.

---

### Additional Notes
- **Splunk Reference**: The HTML mentions Splunk, which isn’t part of the project. This suggests that Splunk might be installed on the VM (possibly as part of a monitoring setup). If Splunk isn’t needed, consider removing it to avoid conflicts:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop splunk
  sudo systemctl disable splunk
  ```
- **Azure VM Networking**: If the issue persists after fixing the port, double-check the VM’s public IP and ensure the frontend is accessing the correct IP if not running locally (e.g., replace `127.0.0.1` with the VM’s public IP in `chatbot.py` URLs if accessing remotely).
- **Diagram**: You mentioned providing a diagram of the stages, but the screenshot you shared is of the application UI. If you have a diagram showing the architecture (e.g., Stages 1–5), feel free to share it, and I can confirm the setup further.

### Confirmation
The issue should now be resolved. If the student still faces problems, please share any new error messages or logs (e.g., from the FastAPI server or Streamlit terminal) so I can assist further. Let me know if there’s anything else they need help with!
